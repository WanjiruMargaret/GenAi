     LEARNING DJANGO:
1.Title and objectives
 -Django was my technology of choice where it is a a Python web framework.
 -Django is a high-level python web framework used to build secure,scalable and maintainable web applications.
 Mostly it's used to build the backend web applications where it handles:
               .URLs(routing)
               .Business logic
               .Databases
               .HTML rendering

-Django uses MVT:(Model-View-Template):
Model-Handles data and database - state/backend data
View-Handles Logic and responses - Component logic
Template-HTML shown to user - jsx.
